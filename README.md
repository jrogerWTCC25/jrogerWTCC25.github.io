# About Me  
My name is Joseph!  
I'm a new student at Wake Tech and have a small bit of tech knowledge going into it. I love music, skating, and gaming, especially with friends! One interesting thing about me is that I'm a fairly prominent coach in a Nintendo esports community. I really got to discover my love for teaching and learning there! And the free trips for winning competitions can be pretty great too! :p

## My Hobbies  
* Coaching teams in my free time
* Playing co-op games with friends (_Minecraft, Helldivers 2, etc_)
* Learning new things, especially related to tech
* Scouring through the lore of Genshin Impact
* Skateboarding (_Though I'm __very__ new to it_)
* Watching awesome creators on Youtube

## Some of my favorite online creators
One of the _best_ resources for knowledge in my opinion is [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com). A few notable ones that pertain to my interests are:  
 * [SkateIQ](https://www.youtube.com/@Skateiq) - It's a channel run by Mitchie Brusco, who is an incredibly talented pro skater. From my experience, he puts out the best educational content on the internet for new skaters like myself.  
 * [My Name For Now](https://www.youtube.com/@DragonMJE) - This one is a bit of a deep cut, but if you play Genshin Impact or otherwise have a soft spot for incredibly intricate lore with tons of interwoven references to real life history and mythologies from around the world, I would _highly_ recommend this channel for in depth analyses on the story of the game. Too many times has this man blown my mind with the way he presents his theories. He's genius.
 * [Illiminate](https://www.youtube.com/@illiminate) - If you're into cars, _especially_ JDM, I would highly recommend looking into Illiminate. He regularly posts long-form vlogs of his adventures to and from Japan, South Korea, and the States, working on cars and enjoying what each country has to offer. More than anything, though, his personality just brightens my mood no matter the circumstances. I just love how genuine he is with everyone including the viewers. Can't recommend him enough!
 
 On the more technical side, I found this cute little site called [Mimo](https://mimo.org/) that acts similarly to Duolingo but for coding. Coincidentally enough it's how I learned a bit about markdown and HTML before taking this class. It made these first 2 lessons much easier to grasp than it would've been otherwise.

## Account Info

This github account was initially created for my web class and functions as a hand-on lab for the first week. I hope to use this account for other classes in the future to help organize my studies and work with others.

By extension, this repository will be where I hold current and past assignments completed in this class.
