<h3>About Me</h3>
My name is Joseph! I'm a new student at Wake Tech and have a small bit of tech knowledge going into it. One interesting thing about me is that I'm a fairly prominent coach in a Nintendo esports community. I really got to discover my love for teaching and learning there! And the free trips for winning competitions can be pretty great too :p

<h3>Account Info</h3>

This github account was initially created for my web class and functions as a hand-on lab for the first week. I hope to use this account for other classes in the future to help organize my studies and work with others.

By extension, this repository will be where I hold current and past assignments completed in this class.
